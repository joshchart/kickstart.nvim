  -- NOTE: Plugins can be added with a link (or for a github repo: 'owner/repo' link).
  'tpope/vim-sleuth', -- Detect tabstop and shiftwidth automatically

  -- NOTE: Plugins can also be added by using a table,
  -- with the first argument being the link and the following
  -- keys can be used to configure plugin behavior/loading/etc.
  --
  -- Use `opts = {}` to force a plugin to be loaded.
  --
  --  This is equivalent to:
  --    require('Comment').setup({})

  -- NOTE: Plugins can specify dependencies.
  --
  -- The dependencies are proper plugin specifications as well - anything
  -- you do for a plugin at the top level, you can do for a dependency.
  --
  -- Use the `dependencies` key to specify the dependencies of a particular plugin

  -- NOTE: The import below can automatically add your own plugins, configuration, etc from `lua/custom/plugins/*.lua`
  --    This is the easiest way to modularize your config.
  --
  --  Uncomment the following line and add your plugins to `lua/custom/plugins/*.lua` to get going.
  --    For additional information, see `:help lazy.nvim-lazy.nvim-structuring-your-plugins`
